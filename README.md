Odin recpies project.


 The goal of this project is to create a simple yet funcitioning website that would allow me to not only demonstrate my retention of all the past knowledge I have aquiared until this point, but also its accurate technical implementation and understanding realting to the basic structures that come with HTML and its beginner level "coding".


  By the end of this project, the website should be fully functional in its infantile capabilities, though with a rough look and bare bone structure, it will serve as a humble beginning a strong foundation as I continue to persue this path in coding and all the prospects it will bring me. Understanding the simple concepts of HTML confirms my interest in this field.
